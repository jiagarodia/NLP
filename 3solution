#You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?

print(-2)
print(+2)
print(2++2)

#In Python, putting a plus sign before a number doesn't change its value either. It's simply interpreted as a positive number. So, +2 is the same as 2.

#For the expression 2++2 , it's a valid expression, but it's not common practice. Python will interpret it as 2 + (+2), which equals 4. So, in Python, 2++2 would also evaluate to 4.
